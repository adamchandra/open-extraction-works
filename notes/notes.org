* Dev Notes

  
  
** Current Goal
*** Tracelog visualizer 
**** Pdf Image viewer
    Display a pdf page as an image, with overlayed text

    - text glyphs highlight on hover and/or nearness
    - regions of text can be selected 
    - blocks of text can be copied

***** Elem Overlays (layering) 
      (div elem) => [...]

      The image/canvas/svg overlay structure
      - Make sure overlays are aligned and z-stacked correctly
      - Draw shapes to svg and canvas
        - Try to take out any helper libraries (d3 and fabric)
      - Zoom in/out, properly modifying geometry of the layers (new feature)

***** WEvent system
      (div elem) => [...]

      The hover/knn event system 
      RTree-based event system lives here
      Allow registration of mouse/keyboard handlers
      Use for glyph highlighting/selection
      Will be used for graph paper variants (regular grid vs. free-form glyph placement)
      

**** Tooltips
**** Filtering/selection engine
     Search/sort/select log entries to display
     
**** Infobar
     Simple cell-based informational display
     (optional, review this before implementing)
     

** Upcoming Goals
*** Text Viewer for TextWorks
*** Annotation Viewer
*** Annotation Labeler
*** Auth/login implementation using Auth0
*** File-based server local development (no db required)
